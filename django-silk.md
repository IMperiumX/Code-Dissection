# What is Django Middleware?

Middleware is a powerful feature in Django that allows you to process requests globally before they reach the view or after the view has processed them. Django processes the `MIDDLEWARE` constant from the settings module during the application startup. This involves several steps: loading settings, validating middleware, and creating the middleware chain. Here’s a detailed explanation of each step, including references to Django's source code.

## 1. Loading Settings

Django loads the settings module, including the `MIDDLEWARE` constant, during the setup of the application. This happens in the `django.conf.settings` module. When you start your Django application, the settings are loaded from the specified settings file, which includes the `MIDDLEWARE` list.

```python
# django/conf/settings.py
from django.conf import settings
```

## 2. Validating Middleware

The middleware validation occurs in the `django.core.handlers.base` module. Django checks if each middleware in the `MIDDLEWARE` list is a valid import string or callable. This validation ensures that the middleware components can be imported and instantiated correctly.

```python
# django/core/handlers/base.py
from django.utils.module_loading import import_string

# Inside BaseHandler class
for middleware_path in settings.MIDDLEWARE:
    middleware = import_string(middleware_path)
    # Validate middleware
```

## 3. Creating the Middleware Chain

The middleware chain is created in the `django.core.handlers.base.BaseHandler` class. The `load_middleware` method is responsible for this process. It iterates through the `MIDDLEWARE` list, imports each middleware class, and instantiates it.

### Key Parts of this Process Include

- **Importing Middleware Classes**: Using `django.utils.module_loading.import_string`.
- **Checking for Middleware Methods**: Specifically, `process_view`, `process_template_response`, and `process_exception` methods.
- **Creating Middleware Instances**: These instances are stored in lists for different stages of request/response handling.

```python
# django/core/handlers/base.py
class BaseHandler:
    def load_middleware(self):
        self._middleware_chain = self._get_response

        for middleware_path in reversed(settings.MIDDLEWARE):
            middleware = import_string(middleware_path)
            self._middleware_chain = middleware(self._middleware_chain)

    def _get_response(self, request):
        response = self._middleware_chain(request)
        return response
```

The resulting middleware chain is used in the `get_response` method of `BaseHandler`, which processes requests through the middleware in the correct order.

To see the exact implementation, you can refer to Django's source code, particularly the `django/core/handlers/base.py` file. The `load_middleware` method contains the core logic for processing the `MIDDLEWARE` constant.

## Django-Silk Specific Middleware

`django-silk` is a third-party Django middleware that provides profiling and inspection tools for Django applications. It can be added to the `MIDDLEWARE` list to enable its functionality.

To use `django-silk`, you need to install it via pip and add it to the `MIDDLEWARE` list in your Django settings:

```python
# settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'silk.middleware.SilkyMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

This middleware will then be included in the middleware chain and can be used to profile and inspect your Django application.

### SilkyMiddleware Class

The `SilkyMiddleware` class serves as a middleware component in a web application. Middleware is a software layer that sits between the web server and the application, allowing for processing of requests and responses. Here’s an overview of its methods:

- **`__init__(self, get_response)`** This is the constructor method of the class. It takes a `get_response` parameter, which is a callable that represents the next middleware or view function in the chain. It initializes the `get_response` attribute with the provided parameter.
- **`__call__(self, request)`** This method is called for each incoming request. It takes a `request`parameter, which represents the incoming HTTP request. Inside this method, the `process_request`method is called to perform some preprocessing tasks on the request. Then, the `get_response`attribute is called with the `request` parameter to get the response from the next middleware or view function. After that, the `process_response` method is called to perform some postprocessing tasks on the response. Finally, the response is returned.
- **`_apply_dynamic_mappings(self)`**: This method is responsible for applying dynamic mappings for profiling. It retrieves a list of dynamic profile configurations from the `config.SILKY_DYNAMIC_PROFILING` attribute. For each configuration, it checks if it is a dynamic context manager or a dynamic decorator. If it is a context manager, it calls the `dynamic.inject_context_manager_func` method with the appropriate parameters. If it is a decorator, it calls the `dynamic.profile_function_or_method` method with the appropriate parameters. If the configuration is invalid, a `KeyError` is raised.
- **`process_request(self, request)`** This method is called to process the incoming request. It clears the data collector, which is responsible for collecting data during the request-response cycle. Then, it checks if the request should be intercepted based on some condition. If the request should not be intercepted, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it sets a flag on the request object to indicate that it has been intercepted. It then applies the dynamic mappings by calling the `_apply_dynamic_mappings` method. After that, it checks if the SQLCompiler class has been patched with a custom `_execute_sql` method. If not, it patches it with the `execute_sql`method. Finally, it configures the data collector with the request model and the profiling settings.
- **`_process_response(self, request, response)`**: This method is called to process the response before it is sent back to the client. It stops the Python profiler, collects the data from the data collector, and constructs the response model. If a request model exists, it sets the end time of the request and saves the request and response models. If no request model is available, it logs an error message.
- **`process_response(self, request, response)`**: This method is called to process the response. It first checks if the request has been intercepted by checking the `silk_is_intercepted` flag on the request object. If it has been intercepted, it enters a loop to handle any exceptions that may occur during the processing of the response. Inside the loop, it calls the `_process_response` method. If an exception is raised, it logs a debug message and retries the `_process_response` method. Finally, it returns the response.

```python
# silk/middleware.py
class SilkyMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        self.process_request(request)
        response = self.get_response(request)
        self.process_response(request, response)
        return response

    def _apply_dynamic_mappings(self):
        # Apply dynamic mappings for profiling
        pass

    def process_request(self, request):
        # Preprocess request
        pass

    def _process_response(self, request, response):
        # Postprocess response
        pass

    def process_response(self, request, response):
        # Handle exceptions and finalize response
        pass
```

Overall, the `SilkyMiddleware` class acts as a middleware component that performs preprocessing and postprocessing tasks on the request and response. It applies dynamic mappings for profiling, configures the data collector, and handles exceptions during the processing of the response.
