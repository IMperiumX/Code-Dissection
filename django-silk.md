# What is Django Middlware?

explaination of how `Django` processes the `MIDDLEWARE` constant from `settings`, with references to `Django`'s source code. I'll provide an overview and mention relevant code snippets.

Django processes the `MIDDLEWARE` constant during the application startup. The main steps are:

1. Loading settings
2. Validating middleware
3. Creating the middleware chain

## 1. Loading settings

Django loads the settings module, including the MIDDLEWARE constant, during the setup of the application. This happens in the `django.conf.settings` module.

## 2. Validating middleware

The middleware validation occurs in the `django.core.handlers.base` module. Django checks if each middleware in the MIDDLEWARE list is a valid import string or callable.

## 3. Creating the middleware chain

The middleware chain is created in the `django.core.handlers.base.BaseHandler` class. The `load_middleware` method is responsible for this process. It iterates through the MIDDLEWARE list, imports each middleware class, and instantiates it.

**Key parts of this process include:**

- Importing middleware classes using `django.utils.module_loading.import_string`
- Checking for `process_view`, `process_template_response`, and `process_exception` methods
- Creating lists of middleware instances for different stages of request/response handling

The resulting middleware chain is used in the `get_response` method of `BaseHandler`, which processes requests through the middleware in the correct order.

To see the exact implementation, you can refer to Django's source code, particularly the `django/core/handlers/base.py` file. The `load_middleware` method contains the core logic for processing the MIDDLEWARE constant.

## django-silk specific middleware

`django-silk` is a third-party Django middleware that provides profiling and inspection tools for Django applications. It can be added to the MIDDLEWARE list to enable its functionality.

To use `django-silk`, you need to install it via pip and add it to the MIDDLEWARE list in your Django settings:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'silk.middleware.SilkyMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

This middleware will then be included in the middleware chain and can be used to profile and inspect your Django application.

- A python class called `SilkyMiddleware`. This class serves as a middleware component in a web application. Middleware is a software layer that sits between the web server and the application, allowing for processing of requests and responses.

The `SilkyMiddleware`class has several methods that are called during the request-response cycle. Let's go through each method:  

- `__init__(self, get_response)` This is the constructor method of the class. It takes a `get_response` parameter, which is a callable that represents the next middleware or view function in the chain. It initializes the `get_response` attribute with the provided parameter.
- `__call__(self, request)` This method is called for each incoming request. It takes a `request`parameter, which represents the incoming HTTP request. Inside this method, the `process_request`method is called to perform some preprocessing tasks on the request. Then, the `get_response`attribute is called with the `request` parameter to get the response from the next middleware or view function. After that, the `process_response` method is called to perform some postprocessing tasks on the response. Finally, the response is returned.
- `_apply_dynamic_mappings(self)`: This method is responsible for applying dynamic mappings for profiling. It retrieves a list of dynamic profile configurations from the `config.SILKY_DYNAMIC_PROFILING` attribute. For each configuration, it checks if it is a dynamic context manager or a dynamic decorator. If it is a context manager, it calls the `dynamic.inject_context_manager_func` method with the appropriate parameters. If it is a decorator, it calls the `dynamic.profile_function_or_method` method with the appropriate parameters. If the configuration is invalid, a `KeyError` is raised.
- `process_request(self, request)` This method is called to process the incoming request. It clears the data collector, which is responsible for collecting data during the request-response cycle. Then, it checks if the request should be intercepted based on some condition. If the request should not be intercepted, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it sets a flag on the request object to indicate that it has been intercepted. It then applies the dynamic mappings by calling the `_apply_dynamic_mappings` method. After that, it checks if the SQLCompiler class has been patched with a custom `_execute_sql` method. If not, it patches it with the `execute_sql`method. Finally, it configures the data collector with the request model and the profiling settings.
- `_process_response(self, request, response)`: This method is called to process the response before it is sent back to the client. It stops the Python profiler, collects the data from the data collector, and constructs the response model. If a request model exists, it sets the end time of the request and saves the request and response models. If no request model is available, it logs an error message.
- `process_response(self, request, response)`: This method is called to process the response. It first checks if the request has been intercepted by checking the `silk_is_intercepted` flag on the request object. If it has been intercepted, it enters a loop to handle any exceptions that may occur during the processing of the response. Inside the loop, it calls the `_process_response` method. If an exception is raised, it logs a debug message and retries the `_process_response` method. Finally, it returns the response.
  
  Overall, the `SilkyMiddleware` class acts as a middleware component that performs preprocessing and postprocessing tasks on the request and response. It applies dynamic mappings for profiling, configures the data collector, and handles exceptions during the processing of the response.
